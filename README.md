Project Summary: Insurance Charges Prediction Using Machine Learning
Objective:
The primary goal of this project is to predict medical insurance charges based on demographic, health-related, and lifestyle attributes using various machine learning models. By comparing the performance of these models, we aim to identify the most accurate and efficient approach for this regression task.

Dataset Overview
Source: A dataset containing attributes of insurance customers.

Attributes:

age: Age of the individual.
sex: Gender (male or female).
bmi: Body Mass Index, an indicator of body fat based on weight and height.
children: Number of dependent children covered by insurance.
smoker: Smoking status (yes or no).
region: Geographic region of the individual.
charges: Medical insurance charges (target variable).
Dataset Statistics:

Rows: <number of rows>
Columns: 7
No missing values were identified in the dataset.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Univariate Analysis:

Age, BMI, and Charges were analyzed using histograms with KDE plots.
sex, children, and smoker were visualized using count plots to observe distribution.
Key Observations:
Most individuals have a BMI in the range of 25–35.
A significant portion of individuals are non-smokers.
Charges vary significantly based on smoking status and BMI.

Insurance Charges Prediction Project

Objective: Built a machine learning model to predict insurance charges using demographic, health, and lifestyle attributes.
Key Responsibilities:
Conducted data preprocessing (handling missing values, label encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data).
Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in age, BMI, and smoker status affecting insurance charges.
Trained and evaluated multiple regression models, including Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Gradient Boosting Regressor.
Achieved high model performance, optimizing metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
Deployed the best-performing model using joblib, enabling real-time predictions for new inputs.
Tools & Technologies: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Joblib.
Outcome: Improved prediction accuracy of medical charges by leveraging a Gradient Boosting Regressor, achieving robust results on unseen data.

Project Description
The goal is to develop a machine learning model that predicts insurance charges using the following features:

Age: Age of the individual.
Sex: Gender (male or female).
BMI: Body Mass Index.
Children: Number of dependents covered by insurance.
Smoker: Smoking status.
Region: Residential region.
The project compares the performance of multiple regression models:

Linear Regression
Support Vector Regression (SVR)
Random Forest Regressor
Gradient Boosting Regressor
The best-performing model is saved for deployment, enabling real-time predictions for new input data.

Dataset
The dataset contains 7 columns:
age, sex, bmi, children, smoker, region, and charges.
Target Variable: charges (insurance costs).
No missing values were found in the dataset.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Data Analysis: Pandas, NumPy
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
Deployment: Joblib
Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/your-username/insurance-charges-prediction.git
cd insurance-charges-prediction
Install the required Python libraries:

Place the insurance.csv dataset in the project directory.

Usage
Run the project script to preprocess data, train models, and evaluate performance:

bash
Copy
Edit
python insurance_charges_prediction.py
To make a prediction with the saved model:
Update the data dictionary in the script with the following attributes:

python
Copy
Edit
data = {'age': 40, 'sex': 1, 'bmi': 40.3, 'children': 4, 'smoker': 1, 'region': 2}
Run the prediction section in the script to get the output:

python
Copy
Edit
model.predict(DF)
Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated based on:
R-squared (R²) score: Measures the proportion of variance explained by the model.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Evaluates prediction error.
Best Model: Gradient Boosting Regressor achieved the highest accuracy for both training and testing datasets.
Outcome: Improved prediction accuracy of medical charges by leveraging a Gradient Boosting Regressor, achieving robust results on unseen data.
